## Problem
When freelancer goes for the job interview or goes to a new client, they are asked 
- how many projects you have done
- wethere it was paid or unpaid 
- what was your working hours
- show your proof of work and so on.

Due to privacy policy of the client they can't show the work what they have done. 

## My Solution 
- Freelancer can show their proof of work in form of NFT 
- AI reduces manual data entry and accelerates invoice handling, user need to write simple english, what work they have done. 
- Accept crypto payment without any hidden fee 


## Understand the flow 
### Dashboard 
As soon as the user connects it's wallet, it will show the all the invoice NFTs that he owns. As well as user can check its status of payment just by entering the invoice number, check the token enabeled for payment of invoice and get other user information just by entering the address. 
### Registration 
User who want to create the invoice, they first need to regsiter on the platform.
One user cannot regsiter twice. 
### Create Invoice 
User can just write out the work what they have done. Rest AI will take care of creating a invoice. Even user can ask to predict the amount based on current industry standard.
Once the Invoice gets confirmed by user a NFT will be minted to the user account. 
### Payee 
Client or anyone on behalf of client can come and pay the amount for that NFT invoice. Amount will get directly transferred to the users account, within few seconds.
